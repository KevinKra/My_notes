### Asymptotic Analysis (Big-O)

- Big-O is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big-O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (in memory) by an algorithm.

#### O(1) Constant

- An algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of input data.

#### O(n) Linear

- An algorithm whose performance _will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the input size._ A for loop is an example of an O(n) operation. Though a desired value may be find early in the traversal process, asymptotic analysis always assumes the worst-case / upper-limit for a given algorithm.
