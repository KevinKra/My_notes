**What does an IT specialist do?**

- Ensure that technology and computer systems operate correctly as well as protecting systems from vulnerabilities and attacks.

### History of Computing

- A computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations. Abacus is often considered the first "computer", it calculated numbers for a user, over the centuries computers continued to developed. By the 19th century, Joseph Jacquard developed punch cards for looms that determined how looms would handle the process for manufacturing textiles. Charles Babbage, a gifted engineer, built the first modern computer. The machine he built, called a _difference engine_ was a mechanical calculator that could perform complicated mathematical calculations. Babbage's follow-up invention was called an _analytical engine_. Inspired by Jacquard, he allowed users to predefine a series of calculations they wanted to perform. Despite how advanced Babbage's machine was, it was still none-the-less a mechanical calculator. Mathematician Ada Lovelace took the analytical calculator to the next level. She realized that the analytical calculator could be developed to accomplish far more than just pure calculations. Ada Lovelace developed the first algorithm for the engine (the first example of computer programming), transforming the analytical engine from being a complex mechanical calculator to become the first general purpose computing machine in history.

Until the 1950s, punch cards will still the mainstay in providing algorithms to a computer. Innovations like _magnetic tape_ worked by magnetizing data onto a tape, and solved several issues surrounding the traditional punch card approach. _Vacuum Tubes_ controlled the controlled the electricity voltages of equipment but were bulky and constantly broke. The phrase **debugging** originated from renowned computer scientist Admiral Grace Hopper when she discovered a literal bug, a moth, to be the source of the problem with their computer relays. The wall-to-wall convolution of electronics and wires, the _ENIAC_, was one of the earliest forms of general purpose computers. Eventually, the industry moved away from vacuum tubes and started using transistors for the role of managing electricity voltages. _Transistors_ are more compact and efficient than vacuum tubes and are still used today, albeit so small and efficient that they exist in the billions on modern machines.

The Xerox Alto was the first modern computer, it also was the first computer to use a GUI. In the 1970s Steve Wozniak, along with Steve Jobs, invented the Apple I, a single-board computer for hobbyists. Their follow-up the Apple II, was ready for commercial use and became a massive success. In the 1980s IBM introduced the personal computer along with a primitive OS called **MS DOS** or **Microsoft Disk Operating System**. Eventually Microsoft went on to create their own OS called **Microsoft Windows** which dominated the market because it could run on any compatible hardware. With Apple and Microsoft taking over the operating system space, an engineer named Richard Stallman started developing a free Unix-like operating system, Stallman created an OS that he called **GNU**, it was meant to be free to use and accessible to everyone with similar functionality to Unix. It was intended to evolve into a fully open-source OS that was not owned by Apple or Microsoft. It set the foundation for one of the largest modern operating systems, _Linux_, that was developed by Linus Torvalds.

In the 1990s as computers became even smaller a new game changer hit the scene: **PDAs** or _Personal Digital assistants_. PDAs allowed computing to go mobile and eventually led to the portable media devices we have today: smartphones.

_What is cryptography?_

- The art of writing and solving codes, the enigma machine used by the german military and is a great example of a cryptographic machine. Alan Turing helped decipher this machine during WW2.

_What is a compiler?_

- Invented by Admiral Grace Hopper, compilers translate the human language via a programming language into machine code. This made programming for more accessible because engineers no longer had to write in machine code to give instructions to a machine.
