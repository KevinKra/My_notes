# Cloud Concepts and Technology

#### What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute, database storage, applications, and other IT resources, through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you pricing.

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense.

   > Instead of having to invest in data centers and servers before knowing you will use them, you can pay for only how many computing resources you consume.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale.

   > Leverage the powers and infrastructure of powerful companies like Amazon.

3. Stop guessing about capacity.

   > No longer have to deal with situations of too little or too much provisioned capacity. Cloud scales dynamically and automatically with business needs without being restricted by contracts or physical limitations.

4. Increase speed and agility.

   > Leveraging the cloud allows you to build platforms rapidly by taking advantage of serverless architecture.

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers.

   > Focus on what matters, not managing infrastructure. Let others manage that for you.

6. Go Global in minutes
   > Easily deploy applications in multiple regions around the world in minutes. This provides lower latency and better experience for customers while incurring minimal costs.

### Three types of Cloud Computing

- IaaS
  > example: EC2
- PaaS
  > example: GoDaddy, Heroku, ElasticBeanStalk, etc.
- SaaS
  > example: Gmail

### Three types of Cloud Deployments

- Public Cloud
  > AWS, Azure, GCP
- Hybrid
  > Mixture of public and private. Example: Public information on public cloud, employee information on private cloud.
- Private Cloud (or on premise)
  > You manage it in your data center.
