## Overview of AWS

### The History of AWS

- Why is AWS so powerful? Amazon allows companies to use amazons web servers(AWS) without risks associated with having to build home-grown servers. This allows for companies with tighter budgets to build into AWS and leverage all the integrated server scalability features that Amazon provides. Additionally, it reduces risks to the company because they no longer have to manage and maintain their own server farm.

- in 2003 Chris Pinkham and Benjamin Black presented a paper on what Amazons internal infrastructure should look like. They suggested selling it as a service and prepared a business case for it.

- SQS was launched in 2004, the very first service released by AWS.
- AWS as a business launched in 2006, targeting developers in Silicon Valley.
- by 2007, AWS had over 180,000 developers on the platform.
- by 2010, all of amazon.com moved over the AWS services.
- 2012 first re:Invent conference

- 2018 AWS launched Machine Learning certificates
- 2019 Alexa Specialty Beta Cert launched.
